### **Higher or Lower Game**

**Overview:**

This is the day 14 project of the course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. This project is a simple Python game where the user has to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100.

**How It Works:**

The game presents the user with two difficulty options:
- **Easy:** The player gets 10 tries.
- **Hard:** The player gets 5 tries.

The user must guess the randomly selected number. After each guess, the game will tell the user if their guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number or runs out of tries.
